      <h3 id="trumptitle">HeadHigh  |  Graphic Design </br> for Independent Bands and Labels</h3>

      <p id="trumptext">

          My obsession with music borders on the manic side. It has always been a goal of mine to help unsigned and independent artists make their way in the music industry.</br></br>

          HeadHigh provides an outlet for me to offer affordable graphic design to the thousands of talented unsigned artists and independent labels trying to stand out from the crowd. </br></br>

          Headhigh also allows me to flex my design muscles in ways that I may not have always been able to at previous employers. With a focus mainly on branding &amp; identity design, print and illustration, my design skills have and will certainly improve.

      <p id="trumptext">

          My first personal digital project resulted in a countdown to the end of Donald Trump’s Presidency.</br></br>

          His divisive campaign for election (and his sexist behaviour) inspired me to create something in opposition of his Presidency. The countdown receives thousands of views a month, and has been described as both ‘a reverse doomsday clock’ and an ‘attack on the greatest living President’.</br></br>

          This personal project also provided great experience with social media, and displayed how effective a strong social media presence can be. Utilising scheduled tweets, original content and interaction with followers, I grew the account to over 1000 followers in just a few short months.
